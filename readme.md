### Changes to Timing Code

I measured the average value size in my random distribution to be ~460 bytes, so I made the cache have a 81% hit rate by simply having maxmem at around 81% of the number of values times the average value size.

I decreased maxmem to **???????????????** bytes to get around the weird bug, **so many of the items in the software cache will probably be in the hardware caches.**
